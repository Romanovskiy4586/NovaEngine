# My Pet Graphics Engine

> **Note:** This repository is public only due to account restrictions — it was originally intended to be private.

Pet project that may eventually become a game engine, but for now it's mostly a graphics engine with a nice (IMHO) standard library.

This repository **is not meant to be public.**  
Due to some restrictions placed on my account, I'm not allowed to have private repositories.
