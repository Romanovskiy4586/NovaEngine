# My Pet Graphics Engine

> **Note:** This repository is public only due to account restrictions — it was originally intended to be private.

Pet project that may eventually become a game engine, but for now it's mostly a graphics engine with a nice (IMHO) standard library.

This repository **is not meant to be public.**  
Due to some restrictions placed on my account, I'm not allowed to have private repositories.  

So if you happened to stumble upon this repo by pure chance, feel free to study it, use parts of it, or absolutely destroy me with constructive criticism :)  

Please note that I don't have a degree in programming and have never worked professionally as a programmer.  
I've learned programming entirely on my own out of pure enthusiasm, and C++ has become my beloved language.
